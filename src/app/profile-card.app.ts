        The Badlands are a collection of buttes, pinnacles, spires, 
        and mixed-grass prairies. The White River Badlands contain the 
        largest assemblage of known late Eocene and Oligocene mammal fossils.
        The wildlife includes bison, bighorn sheep, black-footed ferrets, and 
        prairie dogs.

        Crater Lake lies in the caldera of an ancient volcano called Mount Mazama 
        that collapsed 7,700 years ago. The lake is the deepest in the United States 
        and is noted for its vivid blue color and water clarity. Wizard Island and the 
        Phantom Ship are more recent volcanic formations within the caldera. As the lake 
        has no inlets or outlets, it is replenished only by precipitation.

        The New River Gorge is the deepest river gorge east of the Mississippi River. 
        The park is primarily the lower gorge area around the New River Gorge Bridge, 
        which features some of the country's best whitewater rafting. Smaller noncontiguous 
        sections showcase the ghost town of Thurmond, the scenic Grandview vista, and 
        Sandstone Falls. The other 65,165 acres (263.71 km2) of the redesignated national 
        river is now a national preserve, spanning 53 mi (85 km) of the New River.

        This park protecting four lakes near the Canadaâ€“US border is a site for canoeing, 
        kayaking, and fishing. The park also preserves a history populated by 
        Ojibwe Native Americans, French fur traders called voyageurs, and gold miners. 
        Formed by glaciers, the region features tall bluffs, rock gardens, islands, 
        bays, and several historic buildings.
