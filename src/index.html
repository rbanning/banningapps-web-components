              Covering most of Mount Desert Island and other coastal islands, Acadia features 
              the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coast of the United States, granite peaks, 
              ocean shoreline, woodlands, and lakes. There are freshwater, estuary, forest, 
              and intertidal habitats.

              This site features more than 2,000 natural sandstone arches, 
              with some of the most popular arches in the park being Delicate Arch, 
              Landscape Arch and Double Arch. Millions of years of erosion have created 
              these structures in a desert climate where the arid ground has life-sustaining 
              biological soil crusts and potholes that serve as natural water-collecting basins. 
              Other geologic formations include stone pinnacles, fins, and balancing rocks.

              This landscape was eroded into a maze of canyons, buttes, and mesas by the combined 
              efforts of the Colorado River, Green River, and their tributaries, which divide 
              the park into three districts. The park also contains rock pinnacles and arches, 
              as well as artifacts from Ancient Pueblo peoples.

              The U.S. half of Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park, this park includes 26 glaciers 
              and 130 named lakes surrounded by Rocky Mountain peaks. There are historic hotels and 
              the landmark Going-to-the-Sun Road in this region of rapidly receding glaciers. The local 
              mountains, formed by an overthrust, expose Paleozoic fossils including trilobites, 
              mollusks, giant ferns and dinosaurs. The park is also home to Triple Divide Peak, 
              which forms the boundary between the watersheds of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic Oceans.

              The Grand Canyon, carved by the mighty Colorado River, is 277 miles (446 km) long, 
              up to 1 mile (1.6 km) deep, and up to 15 miles (24 km) wide. Millions of years of 
              erosion have exposed the multicolored layers of the Colorado Plateau in mesas and 
              canyon walls, visible from trails that descend into the canyon from north and south rims.

              Yosemite features sheer granite cliffs, exceptionally tall waterfalls, and old-growth 
              forests at a unique intersection of geology and hydrology. Half Dome and El Capitan rise 
              from the park's centerpiece, the glacier-carved Yosemite Valley, and from its vertical walls 
              drop Yosemite Falls, one of North America's tallest waterfalls at 2,425 feet (739 m) high. 
              Three giant sequoia groves, along with a pristine wilderness in the heart of the 
              Sierra Nevada, are home to a wide variety of rare plant and animal species.
